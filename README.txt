TL AVERAGING
====================

The package calculates the band-averaged transmission loss with range TL(r) from a 
single-frequency TL(r) using Harrison & Harrison (1995) range-averaging approximation. 

It also includes examples and additional functions to compare the results from H&H95 
with the standard multi-frequency averaging and the single-frequency curve, and to
assess the performance and standard error of the H&H95 solution.
